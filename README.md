# windward 🍃

A lot of window managers either:
- require you to remember *a lot* of macros or key combinations
- are inflexible and can only arrange a pre-defined set of apps

windward aims to solve both of these problems by ensuring:
- keys just 'make sense'
- arrangements can be made to any apps you have open, quickly
